Isaac Operations,Performance Improvement Consultant (CO-OP/Summer Internship),"Who we are.
This is an exciting time to join the Isaac team. We’ve been around for over 15 years and
have built a reputation for solving the most challenging front-line operational and financial
problems that some of today’s most important industries face. Loving your Monday to Friday
is important to us. We’ve been recognized as one of the top 10 best places to work in
Canada, which we know has something to do with our culture of rewarding great work with
great experiences, fostering rapid career growth, and sharing the success of the business
with the whole team.

We are hiring Performance Improvement Consultants to join our team for a 2022 co-op placement/summer internship. (Timing is flexible.)

welder, machine operator or technician will help you fully understand the problems that they
face. You’ll roll up your sleeves, run trials, and observe the problems first-hand. This will
give you the insight, credibility, and confidence you need to set the direction in the
boardroom. Your technical, problem-solving ability will allow you to tackle complex
problems, implement change, and ensure improvement is seen on the financial bottom line.
We find this approach much more effective and enjoyable than simply writing reports.

Life at Isaac.

on in your career. You will be challenged beyond your comfort zone, but we’ll be there to
support you - every step of the way. We value work-life balance, and part of this is a rule

the weekend.

Why work for us?

As a co-op or intern you will have the same training & job responsibilities as a full-time
consultant

We offer competitive pay

You’ll do really meaningful work that makes a strong impact for our clients

You’ll have the opportunity for rapid learning and career growth with our training and
development programs

You’ll work with amazing people who genuinely love to spend time together

You’ll get to partake in really fun company sponsored activities & trips

You’ll have a good work-life balance – no working on weekends

We’ve been recognized as one of the top 10 places to work in Canada for the past 3
consecutive years

At Isaac our business is delivered by our people, and we are proud to say that we are an equal opportunity workplace that doesn’t discriminate in employment on the basis of any protected grounds. Including, but not limited to, age, ancestry, colour, race, citizenship, ethnic origin, place of origin, creed, disability, family status, marital status (including single status), gender identity, gender expression, sex (including pregnancy and breast feeding), and sexual orientation.
