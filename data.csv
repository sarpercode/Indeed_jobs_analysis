For students, we believe evaluating you through relationships over resumes, and we are focused on learning about who you are and what you’re interested in to uncover your true potential. In short, we don’t believe resumes will provide us with an accurate depiction of what you’re truly about in order to properly assess your potential. Instead, we want to get to know YOU and hear about your experiences that have shaped you. We know… this might sound crazy but we do not want you to submit your resume. Instead, we ask that as part of your application, you complete the steps below:
1) Complete your PLUM Profile here
2) Take a screenshot of your completed PLUM profile.
3) Complete a very short one-way video interview by clicking here
4) When it prompts you to submit your resume, do not attach your resume! Instead, attach the screenshot of your PLUM profile under the ""resume"" section (step #2 above). Cover letters are optional – not required.
