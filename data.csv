54,OCAD University,"Graduate Mitacs Internship, Applying Generative Design to Co...","Graduate Mitacs Internship, Applying Generative Design to Complete Community Planning
Applying Generative Design to Complete Community Planning brings together growing computational practices in generative design with the urban design challenge of planning and building complete communities. The concept of complete communities is in part inspired by new urbanism which focuses on human and environmental needs. Transportation modes within a community and the network of access that connect complete communities are critical for their design and success. Transportation modes within a community and the network of access that connect complete communities are critical for their design and success. We will use generative design to explore the definition and design of complete communities, both de novo and as an evolution of existing communities. The research will focus on developing feasible neighbourhood designs that lead to higher-density, diverse, and vibrant communities that reduce the need to travel and provide effective options for residual travel demand and nearby services. Research will result in innovations in transportation and urban planning, design practice, in efficiencies in planning, and expansion of the Autodesk suite into large-scale urban planning.
The project is supervised by Dr. Sara Diamond in collaboration with Autodesk as the industrial partner. Autodesk has successfully used “generative design” to tackle design problems in the automotive, aerospace, construction, building information management and consumer goods industries. The computational capacities of Autodesk’s generative design will allow data sets relevant to the complete community planning process to be analyzed and multiple scenarios created which can be tested, iterated, validated, and implemented. The challenges of designing complete communities can be addressed from a variety of constraints (principles, zoning regulations and land use guidelines, community mix, building codes, or financial constraints) with amplified consultation from multiple stakeholders. Case studies will provide contemporary challenges and data. OCAD U continue to build its research capacity in geo-spatial visualization the context of the Autodesk platform. It will train an interdisciplinary intern who is a current GTHA university student who bridges urban planning and digital media/ICT. Preference will be given to OCAD U enrolled students.
Responsibilities:
Undertake literature and policy review to establish metrics that will be used to evaluate a complete community.
Collect community data that can inform the metrics and the generative model and the evaluative component. Engage with stakeholders with faculty leader and advisory team to establish and narrow the metrics. Validate metrics with stakeholders.
Undertake site visits to understand the environment and generic design challenges and engage with stakeholders.
Collect relevant data.
Evaluate candidate complete community designs in an actual case study against various criteria for complete communities such as A Place to Grow, and stakeholder consultations.
Establish metrics, summarize the metrics and their weightings undertake data collection and validation. Build the metrics that describe the objectives or goals of the design problem.
Analyze if and how existing policies, regulations and requirements limit or support the quality of the complete community designs suggested through a generative design process.
Create a prototype that tests metrics for an agreed upon sub-neighbourhood of the case study through a generative geometry model that deﬁnes a ‘design space’ of possible design solutions using computational and visualization strategies and represents trade-offs.
Apply a metaheuristic search algorithm such as a genetic algorithm to search through the design space and ﬁnd a variety of high-performing design options based on the stated objectives.
Use urban scale geometry and spatial analysis to create models and prototypes.
Refine visualization strategies to communicate metrics and related designs.
Use Revit tools to complete fully rendered design visualization for consideration by stakeholders.
Present options to stakeholders. Indicate the trade-offs inherent in reconciling the design constraints with the policy goals and residents’ willingness to live in complete communities and definitions of a complete community.
Create plans for a generative design model of the complete community.
Contribute to consideration of the workflow of an urban design project from a systems perspective, (land use, infrastructure planning, building functions and services, building massing, street characteristics, landscape and public space, amenities etc. with transportation planning, both civilian and freight) to ensure that all systems work together.
Contribute findings to the development of a generalized scorecard for complete communities that is a goal of the four-year iCity2.0 project.
Qualifications:
Current fulltime enrolment in a relevant graduate degree at OCAD University - Non-students are ineligible.
Able to undertake site visits at collaborative industry partner and complete community development.
Demonstrated skills in literature review and analysis.
Understanding of and skill in data collection, organization, and analysis.
